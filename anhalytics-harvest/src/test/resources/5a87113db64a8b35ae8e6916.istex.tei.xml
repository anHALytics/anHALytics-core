rate of synthesis of serotonin (S-HT) in rat brain and spinal cord was
determined by inhibiting monoamine oxidase and measuring the resulting accumulation
of 5-HT. The location of this 5-HT was examined using fluorescence histochemistry.
No alteration of accumulation was seen when the flow of impulses in serotonergic
nerve. fibers in the spinal cord was decmased by sectioning. The accumulation was also
unaltered when the animals were treated with several drugs that reduce 5-HT turnover:
LSD, psilocybin and chlorhnipramine. These results support previous suggestions that
normal control of synthesis of 54-R by end-product inhibition or impulse-controlled
feedback does not function in rats treated with a MAO inhibitor.
The accumulation of 54-R in brain was reduced when the animals were treated with
N,N-dimethyltryptamine, a-ethyltryptamine, p-methoxy amphetamine or pchloromethamphetamine after receivinga monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The same effect also

cccurred in both intact and transected spinal cords. These drugs also caused the appearance of extraneuronal5-HT fluorescence. These effects probably mainly arose from
release by these latter drugs of 5-HT which was not stored in granules. p-Chloromethamphetamine was also seen to deplete 5-HT from the granular stores of normal animals.
p-Methoxyamphetamine, p-chloromethamphetamine and tithyltryptamine strongly
potentiated the hindlimb extensor reflex in spinal rats whose endogenous 5-HT stores
had been depleted. These drugs seem to directly stimulate the central 5-HT receptors
involved in this reflex.

PREVIOUS
studies indicate that psychotomimetic drugs of the indolealkylamine and
phenylethylamine types can directly stimulate serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the
central nervous system. I#2 Antidepressant drugs of the imipramine type on the other
hand seem to indirectly increase 5-HT receptor activity3 by blocking reuptake mechanisms in 5-HT neurons.4*5 An effect common to all these drugs is to decrease the
turnover rate of 5-HT.1*2p6-12 Most of them probably decrease the flow of impulses
in serotonergic nerve fibers.13.14
In the present paper we have examined whether 5-HT synthesis is diminished after
treatment with chlorimipramine or several indole and amphetamine derivatives. In
addition, we determined the rate of synthesis of 5-HT after decreasing impulse flow
in the 5-HT axons in the spinal cords of rats by a spinal transection. As an estimate
of 5-HT synthesis, we measured the rate of 5-HT accumulation after blockade of
its destruction with the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors nialamide or pargyline.

METHODS

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) were injected intraperitoneally with the
MAO inhibitor nialamide (300 mg/kg). Some received in addition one of the following
drugs: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); psilocybin; N,N-dimethyltryptamine
@MT); a-ethyltryptamine acetate; 3,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine
HCl (STP);
mescaline sulfate; pchloromethamphetamine
HCI (Ro4/6861); pmethoxyamphetamine HCl @MA) or chlorimipramine HCI. Doses in the tables refer to the form
indicated here. At intervals, the rats were decapitated while under chloroform anesthesia. Brains and spinal cords were removed and analysed for 5-HT, either histochemically15* l6 or biochemically. I7 Similar experiments were also performed on rats
with an acute midthoracic spinal transection.
Three principal types of experiments were performed. In the first, the drugs listed
above were injected30 or 60 ruin after treatment with either a MAO inhibitor of the
hydrazine type (nialamide) or non-hydrazine type (pargyline). The rats were killed
4 hr after the nialamide (pargyline) injection. In a control experiment with a-ethyltryptamine and nialamide, brain MAO was determined by the method of Wurtman
and Axelrod.18
The second type of experiment was designed to reveal a 5-HT releasing action of
these drugs. Rats were also sacrificed 4 hr after injection of nialamide, but the drugs
were injected only 45 min before sacrifice when 5-HT accumulation had already
occurred.
In the third model used, the drugs were given as in the second kind of experiment,
but to animals pretreated with reserpine in order to prevent granular storage of the
accumulating 5-HT. All drugs in all these studies were injected intraperitoneally.
Those amphetamine and tryptamine derivatives which seemed to release 5-HT were
tested for the ability to block depletion of 5-HT by the displacing amine H75/12
@-methyl, a-ethyl-metatyramine). This test can reveal whether a drug blocks the
amine uptake mechanism in 5-HT neurons (“the membrane pump”).4 The following
drugs were tested in a dose of 25 mg/kg: pMA, SIP, DMT and a-ethyltryptamine. The
drugs were administered 30 min before the first of the two H75/12 injections (25 mg/kg,
i.p., 2 hr apart). The rats were sacrificed 2 hr after the last H75/12 injection, and the
brains were removed for histochemical analysis. Five rats were used in each group.
We also examined the effects of the drugs mentioned above and other aralkylamines
on the strength of the hindlimb extensor reflex of spinal rats in order to evaluate their
influence on 5-HT neurotransmission. This reflex, which is potentiated by most of the
hallucinogens1*2 and antidepressants,3 appears to be dependent on 5-HT receptor
activity. The rats (four per group) were pretreated with reserpine and an inhibitor
of tryptophane hydroxylase (a-propyldopacetamide, H22/54) to prevent storage and
synthesis of 5-HT. Reserpine (5 mg/kg) was given 3-5 hr before and H22/54 (300
mg/kg) 1 hr before administration of one of the above amines.
RESULTS

Nialamide alone caused 5-HT concentrations to rise linearly for about 4 hr and
approach a constant value after approximately 6 hr (Figs. 1 and 2). In view of these
results the 4 hr interval was used in most subsequent experiments. The rate of accumulation of 5-HT was found to be essentially the same in the caudal and cranial
halves of the spinal cord (Fig. 1). The 5-HT in the caudal half continued to accumulate

at the same rate. even when the spinal cord had been transected at the mid-thoracic
level. It was also possible to see histochemically that the ~m~ation
of 5-HT in
both halves of a transected spinal cord was similar. Nialamide (300 mg/kg) was
injected 6 hr after spinal cord transection. Two hr after the nialamide injection there
was a moderate increase in the fluorescence intensity in the S-HT nerve terminals in
both the cranial and caudal halves of the spinal cord of both intact and spinalized
rats (four to seven rats per group) over that seen in untreated controls. Four hr
after the nialamide injection, there was a strong increase in intensity in the 5-HT
nerve terminals but again there was no certain difference between cranial and
caudal halves in either intact or spinal rats.

a-Ethyltryptamine + nialamide. Treatment with a-ethyltryptamine prevented most
of the increase in brain and spinal cord 5-HT levels (Fig. 2, Table 1). This effect was
present through the duration of the 12 hr experiment. Reductions of 5-HT were
observed in doses down to 5 mg/kg. An additional dose-response experiment was
performed using intact animals. When rats (six per group) were pretreated with
nialamide (300 mg/kg, 4 hr) and a-ethyhryptamine (5 mg/kg, 3 hr), they had levels of
5-HT in brain that were 72 f 6% of animals treated with nialamide alone. A similar
effect was seen with a dose of 10 mg/kg (78 f. 7%). Higher (20 mg/kg) or lower
(2.5 mg/kg) doses did not cause effects that differed significantly (P &gt; 0.05) from
controls (84 f 8 %, 94 f 6 %, respectively). With 10 and 20 mg/kg a-ethyltryptamine,
body temperature rose to 39” and 40”, respectively. This hyperthermia might cause
the decreased effect seen with an increasing dose, since high temperature has been
reported to increase 5-HT turnover.1g

* The rats were spinalized on the day before the experiments. They received nialamide i.p. in a dose
of 300 mg/kg 3 hr before killing and aethyltryptamine i.p. 2.5 hr before killing. The organs from two
rats were pooled for each deterr&amp;nation. Values are means of five experiments. Significance of differences were determined by analysis of variance. S.E.M. was 0.072 *g/g.

Histochemically, a 3 hr treatment with a-ethyltryptamine in a dose of 10 mg/kg
decreased intraneuronal accumulation in the 5-HT nerve terminals (Table 2) in
agreement with the biochemical findings. A 45 min treatment with a-ethyltryptamine
decreased the intraneuronal yellow fluorescence in the 5-HT cell bodies, non-terminal
axons, and nerve terminals of reserpine pretreated rats in doses down to 2.5 mg/kg
(Table 2, Figs. 3 and 4). With the higher doses signs of extraneuronal accumulation
of yellow fluorescence were observed close to the 5-HT cell bodies, and nerve terminals
(Figs. 3 and 4). The effects were present both cranial and caudal to a spinal cord
transection.
Since a-ethyltryptamine is known to be a competitive reversible MAO inhibitor,
MAO activity was measured in the cerebral cortex of rats treated with both nialamide
and a-ethyltryptamine. After nialamide treatment alone, the MAO activity was
3-O f 0.2% of normal (eight experiments), and not significantly different from that
found after the combined treatment (3.6 f O-4%, eight experiments). It therefore
seems unlikely that the decreased 5-HT accumulation observed was related to a

DMT + nialamide. DMT in two doses of 10 mg/kg or a single dose of 25 mg/kg
decreased the accumulation of 5-HT in the brain (Table 4). Two doses of 5 mg/kg
were without effect. Histochemically DMT caused effects on 5-HT accumulation in
nialamide treated rats that were similar to those of a-ethyltryptamine: a dose of 25
mg/kg for 3 hr decreased accumulation of yellow fluorescence in the 5-HT cell bodies
and the non-terminal axons (Table 2). With a 45 min DMT pretreatment and especially
after reserpine, there was a clearcut reduction of yellow fluorescence in all parts of the

Rats were injected with nialamide (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 4 hr before killing. One hr later they were injected
intraperitoneally with either saline, LSD, DMT or psilocybin. In some of the rats, the dose was
injected twice, the second given l-5 hr after the Grst. LSD was given either 30 min after the injection
of nialamide, or (as in the last experiment) 15 min before. Rectal temperatures were measured just

Rats which were spinahxed the previous evening were injected withp-methoxyamphetamine (5 mg/kg,
i.p.). Some had received nialamide (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 0.5 hr earlier. They were sacrificed under chloroform anaesthesia 3 hr after the injection of nialamide, or 2-J hr after the injection of pMA. Spinal
cord parts from two rats were pooled for each determination. Whole brain 5-HT was determined in
a group of intact rats treated similarly except that the dose of pMA was 10 mg/kg. Each value represents mean f S.E.M. of eight determinations. P-values were calculated for diierences between the
nialamide and the nialamide f pMA groups (Student’s f-test).

Histochemically, doses of 5-10 mg/kg of pMA caused results similar to those
obtained in the biochemical experiments. A 3 hr pMA treatment (10 mglkg) decreased
intraneuronal5-HT
accumulation in the cell bodies non-terminal axons and the nerve
terminals (Table 2). A 45 mm pMA treatment (5-10 mg/kg) also decreased the 5-HT
accumulation in all parts of the 5-HT neurons with concomitant increase in extraneuronal 5-HT close to the 5-HT neurons. The latter effect was most striking in
reserpine treated rats (Tables 2 and 3). Similar effects were seen after treatment with
STP (Tables 2 and 3).
p-Chloromethamphetamine + nialamide. Only histochemical experiments were performed and only the short time intervals was studied (45 min). Signs of extraneuronal
accumulation of yellow fluorescence close to the 5-HT neurons were found in doses
of 2.5-5 mg/kg and decreased intraneuronal 5-HT accumulations were seen in doses
of l-5 mg/kg (Tables 2 and 3). Effects were observed both cranial and caudal to a
spinal cord transection.
Mescaline + nialamide. Only histochemical experiments were performed and the
effects were studied after 45 mm of mescaline treatment. No effects on the accumulation
of 5-HT were observed with any of the doses studied (Tables 2 and 3).
Chlorimipramine + nialamide (or pargyline). Biochemically, there were no signs
of change in the degree of 5-HT accumulation seen after nialamide or pargyline
treatment when studied at room temperature or at low or high temperatures. However, histochemically at the 45 min interval (as noted previously4) there were clearcut
signs of extraneuronal fluorescence close to the 5-HT neuron and especially after
reserpine pretreatment.

Structural requirements for reflex potentiation. Both the d and I forms of u-ethyltryptamine (5 mg/kg), d,Ea-methyltryptamine
(10 mg/kg), p-methoxyamphetamine

(5 mg/kg) were capable of strongly stimulating hindlimb extensor reflex in spinal rats. As reported elsewhere, LSD, psilocybin,
DMT, MAO inhibitors, Shydroxytryptophane
and (under some conditions) chlorimipramine can also potentiate this reflex.lm3
A number of other amines also potentiated this reflex, but were less potent. De&amp;rite

Little or no effects at 25 mg/kg were seen with gramine; Chydroxyamphetamine;
3-hydroxyamphetamine;
Chydroxy,
N,N-dimethylphenylethylamine
(hordenine);
5-methoxy, a-methyltryptamine
and the indene
2-methyl-3-hydroxyamphetamine;
analogue of NJV-diisopropyl tryptamine. Amphetamine did not appear to stimulate
the extensor reflex in rats pretreated with phenoxybenzamine (25 mg/kg) to block
adrenergic effects.
Mescaline (50 mg/kg) had no effect in the animals treated with reserpine and H22/54
as above, but definitely did potentiate the extensor reflex in control rats. The onset of
this action occurred approximately 1 hr after the injection of mescaline.
The reflex potention of most of these drugs began within about 15 min after
intraperitoneal injection. With p-methoxyphenylethylamine
however, the effect began
after 3-4 min, and lasted approximately 45 min. With a-methyltryptamine, the onset
of action began after approximately l-l.5 hr. In view of the above, the structural
specificity of the 5-HT receptor (or receptors) for aralkyl amines appears rather low.
Both primary and tertiary amines are active. The aryl portion can be either an indole,
phenyl or benzthiazole, but not an indene ring. The alkyl portion can be an ethylene
or ,%hydroxyethylene, but not a methylene group. Hydroxylation of the benzene ring
in the 3-position reduces activity (possibly because of poor uptake into the brain)
and seems to abolish it when in the 4-position. Methoxy-, methyl- and chloro-substituents in the 4-position are all active.
DISCUSSION

findings indicate that (1) the accumulation of 5-HT in the CNS after nialamide
treatment is not altered by nerve section, LSD, psilocybin, or chlorimipramine, and
(2) the accumulation is altered by only certain of the drugs acting on central 5-HT
receptors (DMT, SIP, pMA, a-ethyltryptamine and p-chloromethamphetamine).
It is reasonable in view of the studies on the extensor reflex that all those drugs
mentioned above stimulate 5-HT receptors. Other lines of evidence (see below) suggest
that most of the above drugs such as LSD and psilocybin also alter synthesis of 5-HT,
possibly by altering the rate of impulses in 5-HT nerve fibers. Yet, none of these drugs
seem to produce a blockade of 5-HT synthesis in rats pretreated with nialamide.
DMT, for example, might have been expected to diminish accumulation only cranial
to a transection where the 5-HT neurons are still intact, and receive impulses if the
decrease was to be dependent on changes in impulse flow. But in fact, the decrease
was equally strong cranially and caudally. In view of these results, the decrease in
5-HT accumulation found with certain drugs is not related to a change in nervous
impulse flow. Furthermore, the findings indicate that 5-HT receptor stimulation per se
is not essential for the reduced 5-HT accumulations seen after treatment with the
tryptamine and amphetamine derivatives mentioned above, since no effects were
found with LSD and psilocybin.
A decreased IHT accumulation in both halves of a transected spinal cord can
result from inhibition of tryptophane hydroxylase. However, if these drugs inhibited
tryptophane hydroxylase, they would also lower the concentration of 5-HT in normal
animals (which is not the case). Also, hydroxylase inhibition would not be likely to
have the strong effect seen after near maximum levels of 5-HT had been obtained. A
more likely explanation is provided by our histochemical studies.
The effect of the drugs seems to involve a release of the intraneuronally accumulated

5-HT into the extraneuronal space, either by direct displacement of 5-HT from extragranular binding sites or an action on the nerve cell membrane other than membrane
pump blockade. Uptake of H75/12 by the membrane pump for amines was not
markedly affected by these drugs since they were inactive or only weakly-moderately
active (a-ethyltryptamine, DMT) in blocking depletion of 5-HT by H75/12. In view of
these results blockade of the 5-HT membrane pump cannot be the major mechanism
for the 5-HT release observed. Presumably the 5-HT which escaped out of the neuron
had been located in the axoplasm and not stored in granules. Otherwise, if displacement of 5-HT from granules had been present, the same effects would have occurred
in the control animals treated with a-ethyltryptamine or DMT but not with nialamide.
The fact that in the reserpine treated rats the escape of 5-HT from the neuron was even
greater, further underlines the view that the 5-HT must have been released from
extragranular sites. The release by DMT, pMA and a-ethyltryptamine
of extragranular 5-HT may be similar to the release by amphetamine of extragranular noradrenaline and dopamine.22
As reported earlie+* 5 extraneuronal accumulation of 5-HT occurs also after
chlorimipramine treatment, probably because of blockade of transport of 5-HT by
the “membrane pump” for amines. However, chlorimipramine, unlike e.g. DMT or
a-ethyltryptamine, did not decrease the total accumulation of 5-HT. A possible
explanation of this difference in behaviour, is that drugs which release extragranular
5-HT are more efficient than drugs which block 5-HT reuptake in causing leakage of
5-HT into the extraneuronal space and out of the brain. Another possibility is that
there is a pump for transport of amines out of the brain, as well as into the neuron,
and that chlorimipramine blocks both the escape from the brain and reuptake into the
neuron.
It seems unlikely that the observed pre-synaptic actions of DMT, a-ethyltryptamine
and p-methoxyamphetamine
on the extragranular 5-HT accumulations are of any
great importance for the pharmacological effects exerted by these drugs in normal rats
in which 5-HT is presumably mostly stored in granules. In support of this view the
increase in extensor hindlimb reflex activity found after treatment with a-ethyltryptamine was independent of endogenous 5-HT concentrations: the threshold dose
for eliciting increased extensor reflex activity was similar in rats treated with reserpine
and H22/54 or untreated controls. In fact, DMT (like LSD) is reported to have decreased hallucinogenic effects23s24 when MAO is inhibited and free 5-HT increased.
The discovery in the present paper that a-ethyltryptamine, p-chloromethamphetamine and a-methyltryptamine could directly stimulate 5-HT receptor sites in a way
similar to LSD and psilocybin opens up the possibility that this action could be of
importance for the antidepressive actions exerted by a-ethyltryptamine25 and pchloromethamphetamine,26
and the psychotomimetic effects exerted by a-methyltryptamine.27 It should be emphasized that these drugs also have other effects.
a-Ethyl and methyl tryptamine are well known inhibitors of MAO. pChloromethamphetamine is also a MAO inhibitor,28 and can cause a long-lasting depletion of
5-HT and 5-HIAA in brain. But these drugs also have a central stimulating effect
that appears unrelated to MAO inhibition. 2o Repeated high doses of a-ethyltryptamine can lower brain 5-HT,29 although not to the extent that p-chloromethamphetamine can. These effects of a-ethyltryptamine can perhaps partly be explained by the
5-HT release that is observable histochemically and biochemically after these drugs.

704

JAMES MEEKand KJRLLFUXE
L.

Grieg and Gibbons 2g attributed the lowering of 5-HT levels by a-ethyltryptamine to a
presumably direct inhibition of tryptophane hydroxylase. Our results do not support
that hypothesis.
It is possible that the drop in 5-HT caused by pchloromethamphetamine
is partly
due to inhibition of the tryptophane hydroxylase. Our results cannot exclude this
possibility. However, a direct action on the amine granules may also be involved
since 5-HT depletion is observed also caudal to a spinal cord transection in the absence
of nervous impulse flow, which is not the case with amine synthesis inhibitors. If p
chloromethamphetamine
does in fact inhibit tryptophane hydroxylase in uivo, it
might not do so in vitro, since the inhibition may partly be secondary to the 5-HT
receptor stimulation observed in the present experiments.
The tiding that neither nerve section nor LSD alters the accumulation of 5-HT
after treatment with nialamide is of interest. Current attempts have been unsuccessful
in trying to understand how the remarkably constant levels of brain 5-HT are maintained despite varying use. It has long been known that after treatment with a MAO
inhibitor, brain levels of 5-HT (unlike catecholamines) rise tremendously. It therefore appears that there is little or no “end product inhibition” of synthesis, i.e.
that increased 5-HT levels cannot completely turn off its own synthesis and that a
feedback system other than end-product inhibition must be responsible for keeping
brain 5-HT levels constant.
But, 5-HT synthesis and turnover can be altered in numerous ways in normal rats
without strikingly changing levels of 5-HT. Thus, a decrease in 5-HT turnover is
observed after LSD,lP3’ psilocybin, DMT and SIP,* imipramine11*12 and lith.ium.31
An increase in 5-HT turnover is found after stress32-35 and hyperthermia.lg A factor
common to most of the agents mentioned is that they might be expected to alter the
impulse flow in serotonergic nerve fibers. 1*3~13*14
Direct stimulation of the 5-HT
nerve fibers in the median raphe increases 5-HT turnover;36 section of the 5-HT nerve
fibers in the spinal cord decreases 5-HT turnover.37 Thus, nerve impulse activity seems
to be a major factor regulating 5-HT release and synthesis. The observation that neither
LSD, psilocybin nor nerve section alters the rate of 5-HT accumulation after nialamide
seems inconsistent with the above findings. It therefore must be considered whether
normal control of 5-HT synthesis still functions after monoamine oxidase inhibition.
Such would not seem to be the case in view of our fIndings and those of Lin, Ngai
and Costa30 who found that despite a large increase in content of 5-HT in brain after
a MAO inhibitor, no change occurred in the rate of formation of 5-HT from labelled
tryptophane.
This possibility must be borne in mind when conducting short term turnover
experiments using MAO inhibitors, but may not be relevant when sufficient time for
new synthesis of enzyme can occur. Thus, although an increased accumulation of 5-HT
occurs after long term but not short term treatment with morphine,3* there may be
increases in 5-HT synthesis in both cases.
It is interesting to note that most of the known strongly hallucinogenic drugs except
mescaline seem to stimulate 5-HT receptors directly. Mescaline (or a metabolite3g)
on the other hand, perhaps stimulates 5-HT receptors indirectly since mescaline has
less effect in rats treated with reserpine and H22/54. Most of the tricyclic antidepressants can be classified as indirect 5-HT receptor stimulators which potentiate the

effect of released IHT, MAO inhibitors increase 5-HT levels without greatly a%cting
norepinephrine
levels. Both a-ethyhryptamine
and p-chloromethamphetamine
stimulate S-HT receptors, and in addition seem to release 5HT and inhibit MAO. In
view of the above, it is fascinating to speculate whether hallucinogenic and antidepressive drugs might work on similar receptors in the brain. It may be that subhallucinogenic doses of drugs such as LSD or psilocybin might be effective as antidepressants.
In conclusion, our results indicate that following MAO in~bition, neuronal
impulses do not influence 5-HT synthesis. Thus, normal control of 5-HT synthesis
appears to be lost after MAO inhibition.
We have also observed that DMT, u~thyltrypta~ne,
pMA, STP and pchloromethamphetamine can cause release of the extragranular 5-HT stores produced by
MAO inhibition, whereas LSD and psilocybin lack such presynaptic actions. All the
drugs mentioned above seem to directly stimulate 5-HT receptors. This effect, and
not the presynaptic actions, seem to be related to the hallucinogenic properties of
DMT, STF, LSD and psilocybin.
